# **youtube_results** 📺🔍

A Flutter package that allows you to retrieve YouTube search results efficiently. With features like searching for **videos, playlists, channels**, or **all at once** using a query, **searching by video, playlist, or channel ID**, and fetching **YouTube Shorts** if available, this package provides a smooth and powerful way to interact with YouTube's API.

It also leverages the power of **Isolates** (using Flutter's `compute` function) to extract and process JSON data, improving performance and ensuring that your app remains responsive.

## **✨ Features**

- **Search by Query**: Search for **videos, playlists, channels**, or **all at once** using a single query.
- **Search by ID**: Retrieve specific **videos, playlists, or channels** by their unique ID.
- **Optimized with Isolates**: Uses **Isolates** (via Flutter's `compute` function) to fetch and process JSON data asynchronously, ensuring smooth and responsive performance.
- **Supports Flutter and any platform**: The package is designed for **Flutter apps** (Android, iOS, Web) but can be used in any platform.
- **Fetch Related Videos and Shorts**: If **YouTube Shorts** or **related videos** are available, they are retrieved with a special class `Related<T>` containing the title and related videos list.
- **Fetch Suggestions**: Fetch video suggestions based on a query.

## **🔧 Usage**

### Example Code:
 #### Initialize with your API key or set it as it is.
```dart
import 'package:youtube_results/youtube_results.dart';

void main() async {

  /// Initialize with your API key
  final youtube = YoutubeResults();

  // Sample test data
  String query = "Flutter tutorial";
  String channelId = "UCwXdFgeE9KYzlDdR7TG9cMw";
  String playlistId = "PLjxrf2q8roU2z-h4tG3T_4ORhqyfzYLlh";

```
#### Retrieve all results based on search query
 ``` dart

  List searchResults = await youtube.fetchSearchResults(query);

  ```
#### Get suggestions based on search query
 ``` dart

  List suggestions = await youtube.fetchSuggestions(query);
  
  ```
#### Fetch video using search query
 ``` dart

  List<Video>? videos = await youtube.fetchVideos(query);
  
```
#### Fetch channels using search query
``` dart
  
  List<Channel>? channels = await youtube.fetchChannels(query);

```
#### Fetch playlist using search query
``` dart
  
  List<Playlist>? playlists = await youtube.fetchPlaylists(query);

```
#### Fetch data about a channel using channelId
``` dart
  
  ChannelInfo? channelInfo = await youtube.fetchChannelInfo(channelId);
  
 ```
 ### 💡 Tip
#### ChannelInfo may contain several objects, so be sure to check their types before using them:
  - **`Video`**
  - **`Playlist`**
  - **`Related<Short>`**
  - **`Related<Video>`**

#### Fetch data about a playlist using playlistId
``` dart
  
  PlaylistInfo? playlistInfo = await youtube.fetchPlaylistInfo(playlistId);
  
```

## **⚡ Powered by Isolates**
`youtube_results` uses **Isolates** (via Flutter's `compute` function) to efficiently fetch and decode JSON data, offloading the work from the main UI thread for better performance. This ensures that your app remains fast and responsive even during heavy data processing.

---

## **📝 Remark**  
- **YouTube Shorts** and **Related Videos** can't be directly retrieved unless they are available in search results or if you're using a **videoId**.
- When available, Shorts and related videos are returned as **Related<Shorts>** or **`Related<Video>`**.  
- `Related<T>` is a class that contains:  
  - `String? title`  
  - `List<T>? relatedVideos`
